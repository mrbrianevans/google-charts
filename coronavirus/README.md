 # Coronavirus
 In this folder, I show some graphs that can be drawn by calling an API for up-to-date information and processing the data for Google Charts.
 
 This code can be seen implemented on [my website](https://brianevans.tech/coronavirus)
 
 There are examples of column charts and geo charts.
 
 Perhaps the most difficult part of this project was formatting the data in a way for Google Charts to read.
 
 I struggled to find many examples online, so I am posting this after I figured it out.
